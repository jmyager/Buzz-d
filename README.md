## Why Buzz'd?
Each month, the majority of the population requires a haircut. Some go to salons, some to barbershops, and many to your average hair barn. But regardless of where they go, one singular issue remains: the process of booking and waiting for your barber is a pain. 

After speaking with several local barbershop owners, we set out to numb the pain.

## Overview
Buzz'd is a new type of barbershop experience, where booking your haircut becomes a breeze. The customer can open the barbershop's app or website, browse available stylists (as well as their specialties, prices, and deals), and book an appointment with just a few clicks. Gone are the days of a 60 minute walk-in. And for the barbers, customer information and booking slots are all safely stored in the barbershop's personal database.
